# GoogleMapsAPI 

Google Maps API is a web app that demonstrates my introduction to javascript and the google maps API. The app allows you to search google maps, and see current news stories (Yahoo News) for up to 10 cities within the users view.

This was my final assignment as part of the course "CS50" through edX. I did not write all of the code for the assignment. 

The app uses python and flask to load the webpage.
